# Render Deployment - Current Step

You're at "Choose a service" - here's exactly what to do:

## Step: Click "Web Service"

1. You should see several options like:
   - **Web Service** ← **Click this one!**
   - Static Site
   - Background Worker
   - PostgreSQL
   - etc.

2. Click **"Web Service"** (or "New Web Service")

3. Next you'll see "Connect a repository"

## What Happens Next:

After clicking "Web Service", you'll:
1. Connect your GitHub repository (`quiz-creator`)
2. Configure the settings (I'll tell you what to enter)
3. Deploy!

Click "Web Service" now and let me know what you see next!
